            institutions in the country which became a constituent Faculty of Engineering and Architecture under the
            administration of Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur in the year 1962. Later, looking to the need for
            multi-faceted development of the institution, Government of Rajasthan upgraded the institute to a State
